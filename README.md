# MyReads Project

This is Tim Regan-Porter's final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

## Installing and running

To install and run:

* clone the repository
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Possible enhancements
For future reference, potential enhancements include debouncing search term entries, adding a rating funciton, linking to GoodReads &/or Amazon, integrating other APIs (wikipedia), etc.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
